MELPA-STYLE-RECIPE is either a symbol naming a package, or a list
whose car is a symbol naming a package and whose cdr is a
property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',
and VC backend specific keywords.

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

CAUSE is a string explaining the reason why
`straight-use-package' has been called. It is for internal use
only, and is used to construct progress messages. INTERACTIVE is
non-nil if the function has been called interactively. It is for
internal use only, and is used to determine whether to show a
hint about how to install the package permanently.

:init            Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config          Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that
                 if loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not
                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:autoload        Similar to :commands, but it for no-interactive one.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:after           Delay the use-package declaration until after the named modules
                 have loaded. Once load, it will be as though the use-package
                 declaration (without `:after') had been seen at that moment.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `custom-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.

that are unnecessary, as well as bindings that conflict with
other bindings.

Adding the above bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook'

init file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit'

all the potentially conflicting user bindings have already

Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Setting this variable to nil has no effect if that is done after
the key bindings have already been added.

We recommend that you bind \"C-c g\" instead of \"C-c M-g\" to
`magit-file-dispatch'.  The former is a much better binding

for the position of the desired candidate in the collection,

MULTI-ACTION, when non-nil, is called instead of ACTION when

pattern.

MATCHER is a function which can override how candidates are
filtered based on user input.  It takes a regex pattern and a
list of candidates, and returns the list of matching candidates.

candidates is updated after each input by calling COLLECTION.

EXTRA-PROPS is a plist that can be used to store
collection-specific session-specific data.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is

passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as the
first character of the input string. The format is similar to Perl-style
regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/. Furthermore command line options can be
passed to grep, specified behind --. The overall prompt input has the form
`#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular expressions
to Posix regular expressions. Always enter Emacs regular expressions at the
prompt. `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs search commands, e.g.,
Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions. Furthermore the asynchronous
input split into words, each word must match separately and in any order. See
`consult--regexp-compiler' for the inner workings. In order to disable
transformations of the grep input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler'
accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.

The symbol at point is added to the future history. If `consult-grep'

the directory to search in. By default the project directory is used

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the

substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return

When called, the reformatter will use PROGRAM and any ARGS to

passed as standard input to the reformatter, which should output
them to standard output.  A nonzero exit code will be reported as
failure, and the output of the command to standard error will be
displayed to the user.

The macro accepts the following keyword arguments:

PROGRAM (required)

  Provides a form which should evaluate to a string at runtime,
  e.g. a literal string, or the name of a variable which holds
  the program path.

ARGS

  Command-line arguments for the program.  If provided, this is a
  form which evaluates to a list of strings at runtime.  Default
  is the empty list.  This form is evaluated at runtime so that
  you can use buffer-local variables to influence the args passed
  to the reformatter program: the variable `input-file' will be
  lexically bound to the path of a file containing the text to be
  reformatted: see the keyword options INPUT-FILE, STDIN and
  STDOUT for more information.

STDIN

  When non-nil (the default), the program is passed the input
  data on stdin.  Set this to nil when your reformatter can only
  operate on files in place.  In such a case, your ARGS should
  include a reference to the `input-file' variable, which will be
  bound to an input path when evaluated.

STDOUT

  When non-nil (the default), the program is expected to write
  the reformatted text to stdout.  Set this to nil if your
  reformatter can only operate on files in place, in which case
  the contents of the temporary input file will be used as the
  replacement text.

INPUT-FILE

  Sometimes your reformatter program might expect files to be in
  a certain directory or have a certain file extension.  This option
  lets you handle that.

  If provided, it is a form which will be evaluated before each
  run of the formatter, and is expected to return a temporary
  file path suitable for holding the region to be reformatted.
  It must not produce the same path as the current buffer's file
  if that is set: you shouldn't be operating directly on the
  buffer's backing file.  The temporary input file will be
  deleted automatically.  You might find the function
  `reformatter-temp-file-in-current-directory' helpful.

MODE

  Unless nil, also generate a minor mode that will call the
  reformatter command from `before-save-hook' when enabled.
  Default is t.

GROUP

  If provided, this is the custom group used for any generated
  modes or custom variables.  Don't forget to declare this group
  using a `defgroup' form.

LIGHTER

  If provided, this is a mode lighter string which will be used
  for the \"-on-save\" minor mode.  It should have a leading
  space.  The supplied value will be used as the default for a
  generated custom variable which specifies the mode lighter.
  Default is nil, ie. no lighter.

KEYMAP

  If provided, this is the symbol name of the \"-on-save\" mode's
  keymap, which you must declare yourself.  Default is no keymap.

EXIT-CODE-SUCCESS-P

  If provided, this is a function object callable with `funcall'
  which accepts an integer process exit code, and returns non-nil
  if that exit code is considered successful.  This could be a
  lambda, quoted symbol or sharp-quoted symbol.  If not supplied,
  the code is considered successful if it is `zerop'.

CSV mode is derived from `text-mode', and runs `text-mode-hook' before
running `csv-mode-hook'.  It turns `auto-fill-mode' off by default.
CSV mode can be customized by user options in the CSV customization
group.  The separators are specified by the value of `csv-separators'.

CSV mode commands ignore blank lines and comment lines beginning with
the value of `csv-comment-start', which delimit \"paragraphs\".
\"Sexp\" is re-interpreted to mean \"field\", so that `forward-sexp'
(\\[forward-sexp]), `kill-sexp' (\\[kill-sexp]), etc. all apply to fields.
Standard comment commands apply, such as `comment-dwim' (\\[comment-dwim]).

If `font-lock-mode' is enabled then separators, quoted values and
comment lines are highlighted using respectively `csv-separator-face',
`font-lock-string-face' and `font-lock-comment-face'.

The user interface (UI) for CSV mode commands is similar to that of
the standard commands `sort-fields' and `sort-numeric-fields', except
that if there is no prefix argument then the UI prompts for the field
index or indices.  In `transient-mark-mode' only: if the region is not
set then the UI attempts to set it to include all consecutive CSV
records around point, and prompts for confirmation; if there is no
prefix argument then the UI prompts for it, offering as a default the
index of the field containing point if the region was not set
explicitly.  The region set automatically is delimited by blank lines
and comment lines, and the number of header lines at the beginning of
the region given by the value of `csv-header-lines' are skipped.

Sort order is controlled by `csv-descending'.

Flymake is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Flymake collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Flymake performs these checks while the user is editing.
The customization variables `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode',
`flymake-no-changes-timeout' determine the exact circumstances
whereupon Flymake decides to initiate a check of the buffer.

The commands `flymake-goto-next-error' and
`flymake-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Flymake
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

By default, `flymake-mode' doesn't override the \\[next-error] command, but
if you're using Flymake a lot (and don't use the regular compilation
mechanisms that often), it can be useful to put something like
the following in your init file:

  (setq next-error-function \\='flymake-goto-next-error)

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
by setting properties `flymake-overlay-control', `flymake-bitmap'
and `flymake-severity' on the symbols of diagnostic types (like
`:error', `:warning' and `:note').

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Flymake in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer.  The commands
`flymake-running-backends', `flymake-disabled-backends' and
`flymake-reporting-backends' summarize the situation, as does the
special *Flymake log* buffer.
