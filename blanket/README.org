Blanket is an interface to the Picnic development commands, implemented
as an Emacs package.

* Why Blanket?
  Either it is a romantic picnic or family picnic, we need something
  to sit on and be productive and picnic blacket is the best option
  for that. Otherwise, people can choose to stand or sit on the grass.

* Prerequisites
  - [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]]
  - [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]]
  - [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]
  - [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/yankpad][yankpad]] [Optional for snippets]

* Getting started
  First, you would need to get your user name and access token from Gitlab settings. Then, set environment variables (eg. in ~/.bash_profile for OSX)
  #+begin_src bash
    export GITLAB_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
    export GITLAB_USERNAME=<YOUR_USER>
  #+end_src

  It is not available on MELPA so you would have to do something like
  this in your Emacs init file:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "GITLAB_TOKEN")
  (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "GITLAB_USERNAME")
  (load-file "<PATH_TO_THIS_REPO>/blanket.el")
  #+end_src

  To try Blanket, just call ~M-x~ ~blanket~. This will show the top
  level menu for Picnic commands. ~M-o~ is recommended as a hokey for
  blanket menu if you are using dvorak keyboard:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-o") 'blanket)
  #+end_src

  This is what the blanket menu looks like:

** Gitlab issues
  From the blanket menu, you can quickly list the open issues in
  Gitlab you are working on. The issues are grouped by sprint labels
  and sorted by priority labels inside each sprint label.

** Migration
  From the blanket menu, you can quickly create a migration and 
  then apply or undo it. To do this, go to the picnic root folder 
  first and run it like this:
